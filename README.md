# Coffee-Sales-EXCEL-Dashboard

This project, inspired by Youtube Channel [Mo Chen](https://www.youtube.com/@mo-chen), aims to visualise and present data on Coffee Sales, through the use of Microsoft Excel. 

The dashboard is designed to be interactive, allowing viewers to engage with the timeline and slicers; viewers of the dashboard can explore how the coffee sales for the 4 different coffee types (Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, Robusta) fluctuate over time, based on factors, such as:
1. the type of roast
2. whether the customer had a loyalty card
3. the size of the coffee

Additionally, viewers can observe changes in the top consuming customers, and sales by country. The dashboard and full Excel workbook can viewed [here](https://github.com/03LimbuA/Coffee-Sales-EXCEL-Dashboard/blob/main/coffee%20dashboard.xlsx).

## The process

The provided data (provided by [Mo Chen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m13o5aqeCbM&list=PLxTPgq6AHJUtCI00djlzn60MBhwMc-sq-&index=9)) comprised of 3 Excel Sheets containing information on customers (e.g., names, Customer IDs, country), orders recorded (e.g., Order IDs, Customer IDs), and products (e.g., Product IDs, coffee types, roast types). The project involved populating the blank fields in the orders sheet by utilising Excel functions, such as XLOOKUP and INDEX & MATCH, while also ensuring there were no duplicate values in the data, to maintain accuracy and integrity.
